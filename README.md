INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

ModernGadgets official releases are packaged using the Rainmeter skin installer, and can be found on DeviantArt or through my Dropbox (insert links later). However, if you wish to be a beta tester or otherwise wish to install ModernGadgets using the GitHub repository, herein are instructions on how to do so. These instructions assume you are already proficient with how Rainmeter works, and how to work with GitHub repositories. You will also need access to the command prompt.

First, find a location to clone the repository to that is not inside Rainmeter's skin folder. Once you have cloned the repository, open command prompt. You will be using the mklink command to create a junction between a subfolder in the repository and the Rainmeter skin folder.
