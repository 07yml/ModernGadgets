# ModernGadgets
ModernGadgets is a Rainmeter skin suite designed to be a replacement for the classic AddGadgets.com system monitoring gadgets. It includes an all-new look and several advanced features to give the best possible user experience.

ModernGadgets is released on the Rainmeter platform under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 license. The source code is made available on GitHub under an MIT License.

## Requirements
Rainmeter 3.3 or above: https://www.rainmeter.net

HWiNFO (required for full functionality): https://www.hwinfo.com

.NET Framework 4.5 or newer

## Installation Instructions
ModernGadgets official releases are packaged using the Rainmeter skin installer, and can be found on DeviantArt or through my Dropbox. When installing, make sure to check "Load Included Skins". This will load the setup skin first, which is required for the suite to function (opening any other skin without first loading setup has a chance of crashing Rainmeter).

A more in-depth installation and use guide is being worked on, and will be available on ModernGadgets' website (work in progress).
