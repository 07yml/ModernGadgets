# ModernGadgets
(Name pending change)
ModernGadgets is the latest system monitoring suite by iamanai. It takes the work done on illustro Gadgets and expands, streamlines, and advances its capabilities. Skins are inspired by the AddGadgets.com system monitoring gadgets.

This software runs on Rainmeter, a free and open-source desktop customization tool. Get it here: http://rainmeter.net

Additionally, this software requires HWiNFO, a free system monitoring tool. Get it here: http://hwinfo.com

## Installation and Updates
ModernGadgets uses the Rainmeter skin installer. To install the software, double-click on the .rmskin file (or choose "Open with Rainmeter") and it will automatically be installed and loaded. When you first load the software it will perform a first-time setup which will create your settings file, configure it, and prepare the skins for loading. You will then be presented with a tutorial with further setup information.

Normally, updating a skin suite in Rainmeter replaces every file in the skin suite's folder. This causes settings to be reset to defaults, and any other customizations to be lost. To avoid part of this, ModernGadgets's settings are kept in Rainmeter's settings folder (e.g. C:\Users\Caleb\AppData\Roaming\Rainmeter) so it will not be overwritten when you update.
