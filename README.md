## Repository Information
### Bug Reports
First and foremost, please read through the setup tutorial. You may find that something you thought was broken just needs to be configured properly (e.g. HWiNFO not communicating with Rainmeter). If the problem is not addressed in the setup tutorial, please SEARCH FOR the issue under the issues section of the repository. If the issue has not already been reported, feel free to make a new one. Be clear and use proper language both in the title and the description of any issues you create.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add your own code, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request when ready. A list of things to be done will be kept in the issues section of the repository.

### Suggestions
Rather than giving ideas or suggestions, please try to implement the functionality yourself. Rainmeter is a very open and community-centric platform, and it's fairly easy to learn, so dig in! The [Rainmeter Forums](https://forum.rainmeter.net) and [Rainmeter Documentation](https://docs.rainmeter.net) are good places to get started and recieve assistance.
