MODERN GADGETS
Version 1.0.0
By iamanai

----------------------------------------
ABOUT

ModernGadgets is, as the name suggests, modernized versions of the classic AddGadgets.com system monitoring gadgets. But it's
more than a simple reskin - everything has been rewritten manually to ensure the highest quality and stability possible.
It is inspired by SilverAzide's gadgets remakes for Rainmeter, and partially based on illustro Gadgets, the author's previous
skin suite.

This skin suite includes several third-party tools and plugins. Any issues caused by these pieces of software are not the
responsibility of the skin suite's author.

------------------------------
INSTALLATION AND UPGRADES

ModernGadgets includes a new system for saving user settings. This new system is executed once when you install the skin suite,
and once again if you update it. Using this system all settings are combined into one file (HWiNFO, gadgets, common, etc) which
means it can be easily placed outside of the skin suite's folder. This makes it possible to automatically preserve your
settings across updates.

When you install ModernGadgets it will check your root skins folder (e.g. D:\Files\Settings\Caleb\Rainmeter\Skins) for a file
called 'ModernGadgetsSettings.inc'. If this file does not exist it will create it with all default settings. If the file does
exist, it will be parsed into a table, its values will be cross-referenced with the defaults, and any new variables will be
added automatically. Theoretically, this means that I can change or add functionality that introduce new settings or change
existing settings, and the system will automatically handle adding the new while keeping the old.

An update checker will inform you if updates to the skin suite are available. Once you update the skin suite it will load the
setup skin again, which will go through the entire process detailed above to configure your settings file for any new content
which may have been added. Then your gadgets will be re-loaded exactly where they were prior to updating, so you do not have to
move them where you want them again.
