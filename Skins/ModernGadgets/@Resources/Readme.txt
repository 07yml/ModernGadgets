ABOUT

ModernGadgets is a skin suite with the classic AddGadgets.com system monitoring gadgets, updated and
enhanced to feel more "modern". The included Config skin also lets you change gadget settings, and check
for skin suite updates.

This skin suite is based upon iamanai's previous work, illustro Gadgets, which in turn was based on "Gadgets" by SilverAzide.
