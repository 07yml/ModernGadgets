MODERN GADGETS
Version 1.0.0
By iamanai

----------------------------------------
ABOUT

ModernGadgets is, as the name suggests, modernized versions of the classic AddGadgets.com system
monitoring gadgets. But it's more than a simple reskin - everything has been rewritten manually
to ensure the highest quality and stability possible. It is inspired by SilverAzide's gadgets
remakes for Rainmeter, and some of the UI is based on illustro Gadgets.

This skin suite includes several third-party tools and plugins. Any issues caused by such
software is not the responsibility of the skin suite's author.

----------
Installation and Upgrades

ModernGadgets includes an intelligent system for managing user settings. When you install the
skin suite it will construct a file in the Rainmeter settings folder (e.g.
C:\Users\Caleb\AppData\Local\Rainmeter\ModernGadgetsSettings.inc) which will contain all changable
settings. Since this file is outside the skin suite's folder, it will not be lost upon updating
the skin suite. It is recommended that you store at least one backup of this file, so you will not
have to reconfigure everything if something goes wrong. Additionally, when you do update the skin
suite the system will parse and read your settings file, add in any new settings, and reconstruct
the file. Your customizations will be preserved, but the file will recieve the new content.
