ABOUT

ModernGadgets is, as the name suggests, modernized versions of the classic AddGadgets.com system
monitoring gadgets. But it's more than a simple reskin - everything has been rewritten manually
to ensure the highest quality and stability possible. It is inspired by SilverAzide's gadgets
remakes for Rainmeter, and some of the UI is based on illustro Gadgets.

This skin suite includes several third-party tools and plugins. Any issues caused by such
software ought to be taken up with the author of that software.
